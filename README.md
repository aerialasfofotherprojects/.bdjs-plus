# BDjs
- BDFD JavaScript (a.k.a BDJS) is an another script language available in the app (Bot Designer For Discord a.k.a BDFD) which can be used as alternative to BDScript for developing a Discord Bot. Unlike BDScript, BDJS executes a JavaScript code. It uses ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) JavaScript version. BDJS has limited Discord API functions support available.
- I (books4thoughtgit/aerialasf) is a part of the BDFD community and I thought, "Why is BDjs so trash?". And so I made a Library to make BDjs better.
# How to Use
- Get Node.js
- Go to Terminal
- Do `npm install discord.js`
- Do `npm install bdjs-plus`
# Credits
- Me (thats all for now)
